Project Description

This project is an Android mobile game in the Obstacle Race genre,
in which the player controls a vehicle, avoids obstacles, and collects coins.
The game includes a scoring system, distance tracking, a lives (health) system, and control via on-screen buttons or motion sensors.

The score is calculated according to the following formula:
Distance traveled until game over + (100 × number of coins collected).

Each in-game event provides distinct feedback, including unique sound effects and vibration for collisions with obstacles or collecting coins.
The game includes a high-score system with optional geographic location support, depending on the user’s permission choice.
If location permission is denied, the score is saved without location data.
One-time permission allows location saving only until the application is closed, while permanent permission enables continuous location saving and display on a map.
As a bonus feature, the game supports sensor-based speed control:
tilting the device forward increases the game speed, while tilting it backward decreases the speed, allowing dynamic control of gameplay difficulty.
The project was developed with an emphasis on modular architecture, clear separation of responsibilities,
use of external services as independent components, and proper handling of the Android application lifecycle.
